                    This website is my first project as a Web-Developer.
                    I've only used HTML & CSS for this project, single-handedly by myself.
                    <br><br>
                    My experience as a Web-Developer was terrible at the beginning. I lacked every sort of knowledge and interest at first because I thought it was complicated to learn, but after a couple of months 
                    it actually feels better than before. And after consistent practice I have come this far and I will carry on learning.

                        <h2>C Programming</h2>
                        <p>C Programming Language is also known as Mother of all Programming Languages.
                            It was my first and base programming language, which I learned.
                            My brother suggest me to learn this language, as it is relatable to other languages.
                            So, I worked hard to learn it, and as a result I'm familiar to Program's codes.

                        <h2>Data-Structures & Algorithms</h2>
                        <p>Data-Structures are important if you want to be a good developer.
                            We can find it in every programming language.
                            The best we can learn them is practicing various types of programs with different types of data-structures.
                            <br>
                            Algorithms are important not only in programming languages but also in real world.
                            We can say that, it is a set of instructions to perform a specific task.
                            From my experience, it was tough at first but got interesting later on.

                        <h2>HTML & CSS</h2>
                        <p>HTML which provides the structure of the page, and CSS helps to customize those pages with various properties.
                            They are easy to learn but obviously need a consistent practice.
                            As of now, you can see this website I had done with those practices.
                            HTML & CSS are a part of Front-End Web-Development.
